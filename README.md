    * It handles large-scale account management tasks like **batch domain changes, password resets, and account deletion**, significantly saving time and effort.
* **Automated Transition for Academic Year Changes:**
    * It automatically manages changes such as **Organizational Unit (OU) and display name updates** for students advancing to the next grade, new student account deployment, and graduate account processing. This **streamlines the back-to-school preparation** and minimizes errors.

    * It **integrates** the Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace accounts into a **single ID**, providing a secure and convenient **Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication**. This allows teachers and students to access all learning tools instantly without multiple logins.
* **Automated Class Environment Setup:**
    * **Microsoft Teams Class Teams** and **Google Classroom Classes** are **automatically created** and their members synchronized based on school data, eliminating manual roster management for teachers so they can focus entirely on lesson planning.
* **Public Education Platform Linkage:**
    * It enables **SSO login** (via OAuth/SAML) to metropolitan/provincial education office **public education platforms (e.g., GMOOC)** without separate registration, lowering the barrier to utilizing public education services.

### 4. üí° Expanded Learning Experience and Teacher Flexibility
